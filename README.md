### How to use the flashcards

#### TEX files

These flashcards are formatted to be used with [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/), the digital flashcard software.

1. Download [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/).
2. Make sure you have LaTeX installed on your computer. 
3. Select the deck you want the cards to be in (or create a new one and select it). 
4. Import the `.tex` file:
    - Go to File -> Import. You should see this window:
    - Select the `.tex` file you want to import.
    - You should see an Anki screen with import options that looks like this:  ![How to import tex files to Anki](how_to_anki.png)
        - 1 Select the LaTeX card type by clicking on the field to the right of Type.
        - 2 Choose to have fields separated by a semicolon (; char).
            - You should now have two fields in the file.
        - 3 Choose to update existing notes when the first field matches (optional but is generally a good idea).
    - Click 'Import'.
    - There may be some error messages - most of them don't matter but let me know if you see a proper error.
5. Click on the name of the deck and click 'Study Now' to start reviewing the flashcards! :)
