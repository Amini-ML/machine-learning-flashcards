In range(a,b), is each entry inclusive or exclusive?; First entry is inclusive, second entry is exclusive.

### Lists
Get the index and element in a list; enumerate(). E.g. `for index, element in enumerate(list): pass`.

Add an element to a list; list.append(element)

Does list[:i] include the ith element?; No.

Does list[i:] include the ith element?; Yes.

What does list[-1] return?; The last element of the list.

Generate list e.g. [0,1,2,...,10]; np.arange(10)


random.choices; k-sized list of population elements chosen with replacement. e.g. `choices([-1,+1], cum_weights=None, k=10)` returns size-10 list of elements in range [-1,+1]. \n if cum_weights is None, chosen with equal probability. (Also: np.random.choice([-1,+1], k))
