Two key properties of binary heaps; \begin{itemize}
	\item Shape: nearly perfectly balanced binary tree. Complete tree. (fill in from bottom left)
	\item (Max) Heap property: every node has a value at least as large as those of its children.
\end{itemize}

Is there a left-right orientation as to which child of a node is larger in a max heap?; No.

Can a node on a lower level of a max heap have a larger value than a node on a higher level?; Yes, as long as that node is not a direct descendant of the node on the higher level.

What data structure do you use to implement a heap?; An array. Index top to bottom, left to right. (Root is index 0/1 depending on if you're using a 0-indexed or 1-indexed language.)

What is the index of the parent, left and right children of node i in a heap?; If 1-indexed: \begin{itemize}
	\item parent: floor(i/2), i.e. i // 2.
	\item left child: 2i
	\item right child: 2i + 1
\end{itemize}
